# web_scrape_challenge


In this challenge, we scraped a website for info about various articles on Mars, and on data collected by Curiousity, and put it into various graphs.  
First we took the current articles out of the website on mars news, and later on we used Curiousity data to find max and min temperatures, how many days
are in a Martian year, and various other details about the Planet.
